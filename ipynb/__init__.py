ACT Jupyter Notebooks (Project Root)

This directory contains interactive Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating
and visualizing ACT's verification capabilities.

Available Notebooks:
- torchvision_visualization.ipynb: TorchVision dataset visualization with custom perturbations

Note: This directory is at the project root for easy access and to keep
notebooks separate from the main Python package structure.
